<h2 class="my-4">About & Help</h2>

<p>
  This website is based on <a href="https://github.com/osm-search/nominatim-ui">Nominatim UI</a>,
  a debugging interface for the <a href="https://nominatim.org/">Nominatim</a> geocoding software.
</p>

<p>
  The Nominatim API is installed at <code>Nominatim_API_Endpoint</code> and for questions you
  should contact their administrators.
</p>

<p>
  Nominatim is a search engine for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data.
  You may search for a name or address (forward search) or look up data by its geographic coordinate
  (reverse search). Each result comes with a link to a details page where you can inspect what data
  about the object is saved in the database and investigate how the address of the object has been
  computed.
