  <h2>Welcome to Nominatim</h2>

  <p>
    Nominatim is a search engine for
    <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data. This
    is the debugging interface. You may search for a name or address
    (forward search) or look up data by its geographic coordinate (reverse
    search). Each result comes with a link to a details page where you
    can inspect what data about the object is saved in the database and
    investigate how the address of the object has been computed.
